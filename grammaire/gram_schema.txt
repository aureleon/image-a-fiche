Please utilize all of the information in any text passed to create a JSON schema for a grammar focused flash card deck.

You should expect markdown similar to the following <expected_content_*> formats, but in the event that you do not, try your best to determine which tokens are intended to be utilized.

The input may contain words from multiple languages, including French, whereas the output tokens should entirely be in French.

Do not add any miscellaneous or filler responses to the beginning or end of your responses, include only necessary tokens to fit the JSON schema.
